## Setup Julia development environment in mainland China

1. Install and update Julia language compiler, please check [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup),

2. Setup the Julia binary providers to speed up the download, please check https://mirror.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/julia/ to use the Tuna mirror site.

3. Coding wih Julia language usually requires an editor, and it is highly recommended to use VSCode.
You may find an instruction to install julia-vscode [here](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode), alternatively, you can search the extension for Julia in VSCode.

4. Setup [`Revise`](https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl) properly, so that when you develop a package,
the changes in the package can be recompiled in real time. Otherwise, you will have to restart a Julia session frequently.
