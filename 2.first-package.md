# Packages and projects

Julia packages are scattered on Github, e.g. the package `Yao` is in a Github repo [Yao.jl](https://github.com/QuantumBFS/Yao.jl).
To locate these packages, Julia uses the a special Github repository as the registry of packages.
The default one is called `General` registry.

```julia
(@v1.8) pkg> registry status
Registry Status 
 [23338594] General (https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General.git)
```

Each package has a special file called `Project.toml` in the top level folder, which includes the dependency information.
When you install a package, Julia resolves this dependency tree and install the dependencies and generate the `Manifest.toml` file.

It is recommended to start a new Julia project as a Julia package so that the dependency can be resolved properly.
It is very simple to create a new Julia package with [PkgTemplates](https://github.com/JuliaCI/PkgTemplates.jl).
A minimum example is as follows.

```julia
pkg> add PkgTemplates

julia> using PkgTemplates

julia> tpl = Template(; user="GiggleLiu")

julia> tpl("Demo")
```

A fresh new project will be generate in folder `~/.julia/dev/Demo` (for Linux and Mac).

### How to contribute to a package

```
