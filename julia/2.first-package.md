# Packages and projects

Julia packages are scattered on Github, e.g. the package `Yao` is in a Github repo [Yao.jl](https://github.com/QuantumBFS/Yao.jl).
To locate these packages, Julia uses the a special Github repository as the registry of packages.
The default one is called `General` registry.

```julia
(@v1.8) pkg> registry status
Registry Status 
 [23338594] General (https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General.git)
```

Each package has a special file called `Project.toml` in the top level folder, which includes the dependency information.
When you install a package, Julia resolves this dependency tree and install the dependencies and generate the `Manifest.toml` file.

## Create and release your first package

### 1. Create a package using `PkgTemplates`
It is recommended to start a new Julia project as a Julia package so that the dependency can be resolved properly.
It is very simple to create a new Julia package with [PkgTemplates](https://github.com/JuliaCI/PkgTemplates.jl).
A minimum example is as follows.

```julia
pkg> add PkgTemplates

julia> using PkgTemplates

julia> tpl = Template(; user="MyGithubUserOrOrg", plugins=[
    GitHubActions(; extra_versions=["nightly"]),
    Git(),
    Codecov(),
    Documenter{GitHubActions}(),
])

julia> tpl("Demo")
```

A fresh new project will be generate in folder `~/.julia/dev/Demo` (or `%HOME%/.julia/dev/Demo` for Windows users). The file structure of this project is
```zsh
(base) ➜  Demo git:(main) tree .
.
├── docs
│   ├── make.jl                 # The make file for the documents
│   ├── Manifest.toml           # The resolved dependency for the `docs` environment
│   ├── Project.toml            # The dependency specification for the `docs` environment
│   └── src
│       └── index.md            # The document home page
├── .github
│   └── workflows               # Files in this folder specify jobs run by Github Action automatically.
│       ├── CI.yml              # Run tests and calculate the test coverage
│       ├── CompatHelper.yml    # Help your package dependency up to date by creating a pull request.
│       └── TagBot.yml          # Auto-tag a version after registering a new version in a Julia registry.
├── .gitignore      # Ignored files will not be considered a part of the `git` repo.
├── LICENSE         # MIT license by default
├── Manifest.toml   # The resolved dependency
├── Project.toml    # The package name, UUID and dependencies
├── README.md       # README in markdown format
├── src             # The folder for Julia source code
│   └── Demo.jl     # The main file for the `Demo` module
└── test            # The folder for Julia test code
    └── runtests.jl # The main file for testing.
```

* [Github Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

Some extra steps are required,

  * Setup the Github pages,
  * Connect your repo with [CodeCov](https://about.codecov.io/) correctly.

### 2. Create a Github repo
The github repo name should be the same as your Julia package name.
In our example, it is `Demo.jl`. Push your local files to the remote.

### 3. Develop and manage your package dependency

### 4. Release your package
You can offically release this package to make it accessible to the public by registering your package in Julia's [General registry](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General).
You may find an instruction about how to register a package in the github repo [Registrator.jl](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl).
After a 3 days review procedure, your package will be installable in the Pkg mode.

### How to contribute to a package

Fork a package,

```julia
pkg> dev <link to github repo>
```

Local and global environment
